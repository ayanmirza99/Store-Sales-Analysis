# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Electric Store Sales
This repository contains the code and visualizations for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of electric store sales data. The data was obtained from the Kaggle Electric Appliances Store Dataset [invalid URL removed].

## Analysis Techniques:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization with libraries like pandas and matplotlib
- Insights into sales trends, product categories, and customer behavior
## Project Structure:

- data: Contains the electric store sales dataset (replace with actual filename if different)
- notebook: Jupyter Notebooks containing the EDA code and visualizations (modify if using scripts)
- README.md: This file (you are here!)
## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib (and any other libraries used)
## Running the Notebooks:

- Clone this repository.
- Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt (if you have a requirements.txt file).
- Open a Jupyter Notebook environment and navigate to the notebooks folder.
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., EDA_Electric_Store_Sales.ipynb).
## Further Exploration:

This EDA provides a foundation for understanding electric store sales data. You can extend this analysis by:

- Investigating specific product categories
- Analyzing customer demographics
- Feel free to contribute!

## Disclaimer:

This code and analysis are provided for educational purposes only. The data and findings may not be representative of all electric stores.
